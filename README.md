MyRadio
=======

Hey! You've stumbled upon URY's web management system for all of its operations.
Internally called MyURY, this will be generalised and documented over the
coming months so that it will hopefully be usable for anyone wanting to start
their own community or student radio venture.

MyRadio is part of a suite of upcoming public projects, including:
- iTones, our liquidsoap sustainer system
- loggerng, our python audio logging and retriving system
- Bootstrapping scripts for setting up and configuring all the dependencies

MyRadio uses GitHub Flow as a development workflow: https://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/
